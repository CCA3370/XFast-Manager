const bundledChangelog = "# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),\nand this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\n## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-28\n\n### Added\n\n- **Lua Companion Bundle Support** - Lua scripts now detect `SCRIPT_DIRECTORY` companion files/folders and install them together; companion items are shown in the confirmation list with expandable details.\n- **Lua Lock Controls in Scripts Page** - Lua entries now support lock/unlock directly in the Lua management page.\n- **Batch Mode for Aircraft/Plugin Management** - Added multi-select with full-row \"Select All\" behavior and batch enable/disable actions.\n- **Drop-Zone File Picker** - Clicking the drag-and-drop area now opens a file picker for manual file selection.\n- **UFMC Navdata Support** - Added installation support for UFMC-type navdata (providers `Universal FMC (UFMC)` and `Modern UFMC`); installs to `Custom Data/UFMC`.\n\n### Changed\n\n- **7z Analysis and Install Performance** - Improved 7z scanning speed (including nested archive handling) and password/encryption detection responsiveness.\n- **7z Size Estimation Accuracy** - Installation size display for 7z sources is now based on archive metadata instead of rough multipliers.\n- **Scenery Priority Ordering** - `Lines3D` is now kept at the top of fixed high-priority scenery libraries.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- **X-Plane Elevation Error Guidance** - When launch fails with Windows error 740, the app now shows actionable cause/solution guidance instead of only a generic failure message.\n- **Unsupported Navdata UX** - Unknown navdata formats no longer interrupt scan flow with a blocking failure modal.\n- **Lua Install Compatibility** - Fixed Lua install flow so Lua tasks no longer fail with `Unsupported archive format: lua`.\n- **Default Aircraft Protection** - Required default X-Plane aircraft can no longer be disabled by mistake.\n- **Navdata Backup Consistency** - Backup location is now consistent with atomic mode (`Custom Data/Backup_Data`), cleanup removes only same-provider backups, and full navdata folder content is included in backup scope.\n- **Failed Task Detail Navigation** - In the install-failed flow, clicking a failed task now opens only that task's error details instead of an aggregated all-task error panel.\n- **Bug Report Availability in Failure Details** - Error details opened from failed tasks now use the unified error modal, so auto-report and privacy notice are available there as well.\n\n## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-27\n\n### Added\n\n- **X-Plane Log Analysis** - Added a dedicated log analysis page to quickly inspect errors and troubleshooting details.\n- **Parallel Installation (Experimental)** - Added optional parallel install mode with conflict awareness for overlapping target paths.\n- **Update Changelog Display** - Added automatic changelog display on first startup after updates, with manual viewing option in Settings.\n- **Bug Report Follow-Up UX** - Issue update flow and messaging were refined for clearer status communication after reporting problems.\n\n### Changed\n\n- **Installation Progress Feedback** - Progress display now reports phase/task updates more clearly, including improved tracking when parallel mode is enabled.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- **Scenery Error Messages** - Failure notifications now include clearer error details in scenery-related operations.\n- **Path Conflict Handling** -

2026-02-24\n\n### Fixed\n\n- **Linux File Manager** - Fixed `open_in_explorer` on Linux opening folders in a browser instead of the file manager; now tries common file managers (nautilus, dolphin, thunar, nemo, pcmanfm) before falling back to xdg-open\n- **Linux X-Plane Detection** - Path validation, executable launch, and process detection now use `X-Plane*` glob matching instead of a hardcoded `X-Plane` filename\n\n### Changed\n\n- **Update Download URL** - \"Download\" button now selects URL based on current language\n- **Error Messages** - Updated invalid path error messages to remove platform-specific executable suffix\n\n## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-24\n\nThis is the first official public release of XFast Manager.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- **Toggle-Enabled Event Propagation** - Fixed the enable/disable toggle button in management cards triggering unintended parent click events\n- **Auto-Lock Sync on Disable/Enable** - Disabling an aircraft or plugin now immediately locks it in the UI and syncs to `skunkcrafts_updater.cfg`; re-enabling auto-unlocks it (manual locks are preserved)\n\n### Changed\n\n- **Livery Pattern Detection** -
